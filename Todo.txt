1. Allow users to add charges to spread sheet
2. Program adds up totals and matches to budget on spreadsheet
	Maybe adds a statement to the sheet with how much money is left in budget or how much over you are
3. Create GUI interface for enetering in values
4. Save additions to a file so user can save their data without needing to keep entering every time the app is started
	Will just make program rebuild and add whatever is saved in the file as to not mess up formatting
